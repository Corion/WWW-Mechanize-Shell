    to allow for urls like http://mark@foo.com (thanks Mark)
  - Added tests to check that created scripts at least compile
  - Made the form fillout more robust by wrapping it in an eval block

0.14 20030414
  - Fixed a bad list bug introduced with my unix-browser patch to the options system. Slaven Rezics
    submitted patch had nothing to do with this, I only grabbed the idea from him but did botch
    the implementation myself.
  - Added a test that all options can be set and reset
  - Reenabled all warnings in the tests
  - Removed one warning for an unavailable module
  - Added first part of JavaScript handling :
      The shell detects when you want to follow a javascript: link,
      and says that you can't do that.

    display under Unix ! Thanks go to Slaven !!
