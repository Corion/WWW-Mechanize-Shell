Revision history for Perl extension WWW::Mechanize::Shell.

0.23
  - "submit" didn't reload the browser HTML. Thanks to Slaven Rezic.
  - t/14* now skips instead of fails tests that can't succeed.
  - fixed test failing if Term::ReadKey was not available
  - fixed synopsis not reading the .mechanizerc
  - made WWW::Mechanize::Shell use the "reload" method of WWW::Mechanize
    (after all, I asked for that method ...)
  - Test for multivalues added, but it's not testing the right stuff yet
    (see https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=2700 ). Not in MANIFEST
    and/or distribution, but the Changes file is also for me :-)
  - clarified documentation about "watchfiles" and "autoreload" (thanks to
    Mark Stosberg)
  - Documentation fixes for "open" and "links" (also courtesy of Mark Stosberg)
  - The dumprequests feature needs Hook::LexWrap - it didn't work
    properly before. The feature is tested in t/14
  - factored out the HTML display into a module of its own (HTML::Display)
  - "restart" in a -e oneliner dosen't crash the shell (it also dosen't restart though)

0.22
  - The module now requires WWW::Mechanize v0.43, as the internal
    API of WWW::Mechanize changed. Mixing W::M::S 0.21 or below with W::M v0.43+
    will not work as will mixing W::M::S 0.22+ with W::M v0.41-
  - Added new command "reload", which repeats the last request
    (intended for testing/modifying server side code)
  - Altered fillout command - now _all_ fields that aren't predefined
    via an "autofill" command get asked interactively. Previously fields
    that already had a value weren't asked. This means that you maybe
    have to rewrite parts of your scripts if you are using the shell
    as a testing tool. See t/14* and t/16* for scripts that redefine
    the interactive asking method to something noninteractive.
    Field types that do not get asked are : hidden,submit
  - The "eval" command now takes multiline strings. This is not interesting
    if you're using the plain shell, as the readline shell dosen't know about
    about multiline strings, but if you're using the $shell->cmd() feature,
    it's handy to split your evals over more than one line.

0.21
  - Fixed error in one-liner usage
  - Fixed embarassing errors in 'forms' and 'save' commands

0.20
  - made t/00a*.t a TODO test so that CPAN install (silently) works

  - added documentation for some more methods
  - added understanding of "#" as a comment
  - added a "save" command to save links into files
  - added "auth" command for basic authentication (suggested by merlyn)
  - added live test of the auth command against HTTP::Daemon (code provided by merlyn)
  - added test that 'url' basic authentication also works (http://login:password@example.com)
  - added convenience "shell" module method :
      perl -MWWW::Mechanize::Shell -e "shell"
  - added full end-to-end testing for many commands and their generated scripts
  - fixed many bugs in the generated scripts
  - many documentation fixes

0.18
  - No functional changes to v0.17
  - Discovered that and documented how file uploads work
  - Added BUGS section to documentation

0.17
  - Fixed a doc bug where "exit" referred to the (nonexistent) "quit" topic (thanks Mark)
  - Made a test checking the version of Term::Shell and the help summary bug
  - Fixed t/06*.t - it crashed when Test::MockObject wasn't installed

0.16 20030429
  - Changed double quotes around parameters to single quotes
    to allow for urls like http://mark@foo.com (thanks Mark)
  - Added tests to check that created scripts at least compile
  - Made the form fillout more robust by wrapping it in an eval block

0.14 20030414
  - Fixed a bad list bug introduced with my unix-browser patch to the options system. Slaven Rezics
    submitted patch had nothing to do with this, I only grabbed the idea from him but did botch
    the implementation myself.
  - Added a test that all options can be set and reset
  - Reenabled all warnings in the tests
  - Removed one warning for an unavailable module
  - Added first part of JavaScript handling :
      The shell detects when you want to follow a javascript: link,
      and says that you can't do that.

0.13 20030404
  - Slaven Rezic submitted a patch to enable synchronous HTML
    display under Unix ! Thanks go to Slaven !!
    All bugs/errors are my fault !
  - fixed a crash if the url to the get command was invalid

  - Added a test to check for the behaviour if HTML::TableExtract is not present
  - silenced warnings in the tests

    (as is the case when the tests are run from cron)
  - Fixed the inline tests so the synopsis shows again

0.10 20030312
  - Added the "table" command to display/dump HTML tables using HTML::TableExtract
  - Added "table" history

0.07 20030308
