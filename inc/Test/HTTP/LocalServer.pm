=head 2 C<Test::HTTP::LocalServer-E<gt>spawn %ARGS>

This spawns a new HTTP server. The server will stay running until
  $server->stop
is called.

Valid arguments are :

  html => scalar containing the page to be served
  file => filename containing the page to be served
  debug => 1 # to make the spawned server output debug information

All served HTML will have the first %s replaced by the current location.

  my ($class,%args) = @_;
  my $self = { %args };
  bless $self,$class;

  local $ENV{TEST_HTTP_VERBOSE} = 1

  $self->{delete} = [];

=head2 C<$server-E<gt>port>

This returns the port of the current server. As new instances
will most likely run under a different port, this is convenient
if you need to compare results from two runs.

=cut

sub port { 
  carp __PACKAGE__ . "::port called without a server" unless $_[0]->{_server_url};
  $_[0]->{_server_url}->port
};

=head2 C<$server-E<gt>url>

This returns the url where you can contact the server. This url
is valid until you call
  $server->stop;
or
  $server->get_output;

=cut

sub url { 
  $_[0]->{_server_url}->abs
};

=head2 C<$server-E<gt>stop>

This stops the server process by requesting a special
url.

=cut

sub stop { 
  get( $_[0]->{_server_url} . "quit_server" ); 
  undef $_[0]->{_server_url}
};

=head2 C<$server-E<gt>get_output>

This stops the server by calling C<stop> and then returns the
output of the server process. This output will be a list of
all requests made to the server concatenated together
as a string.

=cut

sub get_output {
  my ($self) = @_;
  $self->stop;
  local $/;
  local *LOG;
  open LOG, "<", $self->{logfile}
    or die "Couldn't retrieve logfile";
  join "", <LOG>;
};

sub DESTROY { 
  $_[0]->stop if $_[0]->{_server_url};
  for my $file (@{$_[0]->{delete}}) {
    unlink $file or warn "Couldn't remove tempfile $file : $!\n";
  };
};
