=head 2 C<Test::HTTP::LocalServer-E<gt>spawn %ARGS>

This spawns a new HTTP server. The server will stay running until
  $server->stop
is called.

Valid arguments are :

  html => scalar containing the page to be served
  file => filename containing the page to be served
  debug => 1 # to make the spawned server output debug information

All served HTML will have the first %s replaced by the current location.

  my $self = { %args };

    # write the html to a temp file

=head2 C<$server-E<gt>port>

This returns the port of the current server. As new instances
will most likely run under a different port, this is convenient
if you need to compare results from two runs.

=cut

sub port { URI::URL->new($_[0]->url)->port };

=head2 C<$server-E<gt>url>

This returns the url where you can contact the server. This url
is valid until you call
  $server->stop;
or
  $server->get_output;

=cut

sub url { $_[0]->{_server_url} };

=head2 C<$server-E<gt>stop>

This stops the server process by requesting a special
url.

=cut

sub stop { get( $_[0]->{_server_url} . "quit_server" )};

=head2 C<$server-E<gt>get_output>

This stops the server by calling C<stop> and then returns the
output of the server process. This output will be a list of
all requests made to the server concatenated together
as a string.

=cut

sub get_output {
  my ($self) = @_;
  $self->stop;
  my $fh = $self->{_fh};
  my $result = join "\n", <$fh>;
  $self->{_fh}->close;
  $result;
